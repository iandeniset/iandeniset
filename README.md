# Ian Deniset
> I am an Environmental Scientist with a background in both geophysics and geotechnical engineering.  When possible, I try to incorporate writing code into anything and everything.

## About Me
- I have a B.Sc. in Geophysics and an M.Sc. in Geotechnical Engineering
- I love everything to do with seismic data and geophysics in general
- Rocks and soil are cooler than most people give them credit for
- `plaintext` is the best
- Sometimes I wish I had studied computer science for one of my degrees

## Some Cool Things I Did
- [My Masters thesis](https://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/handle/1993/34862) focusing on the use of geophysics for geotechnical site investigations.
- [Course assignment solutions](https://github.com/iandeniset/GEOL7720) for a graduate class in geophysical imaging and data processing; Exercise 5 is my favorite.
- [Some code](https://github.com/iandeniset/geotechLogs) for generating and plotting geotechnical borehole logs; it can also do cross-sections.
- [Seismic visualization notebooks](https://github.com/iandeniset/GeophysicsNotebooks) from back when I interpreted seismic for a living.
